## social-pairs
##### an idea for a trading system that uses pair trades
##### to reduce market risk and uses social media data to 
##### discover pair trades.

##### strategy: 
- track social performance (volume, engagement, dominance, sentiment)
- rank assets based on metrics (or an aggregate of metrics)
- long asset with superior social performance
- short asset with inferior social performance
- switch assets on a 'cross' in social performance

##### example:
- asset X & Y are comparable or substitute assets.
- asset X has outpeformed asset Y in price and social performance 
  for some time. 
- now, asset Y has started to outperform asset X in social performance.
- strategy longs asset Y and shorts asset X. 
- strategy closes (or reverses) trade at a predefined ratio or when 
  asset X begins to outperform asset Y in social performance.
